    <h1>Classifying images using MobileNet in TensorFlow.js</h1>
    
    <p>This demo page shows how we can take a pretrained model created by the TensorFlow.js team, in this case one called MobileNet, so that we can use it to find what object maybe in an image. MobileNet has been trained to detect a number of objects. If what you want to recognize is in that list of things it knows about, this may be useful to you. If you want to train a system to recognize your own objects, then check out our tutorials on transfer learning.</p>
