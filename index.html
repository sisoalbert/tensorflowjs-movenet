      <h2>Difficulty: Easy</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Please note:</em> This loads a nice easy to use JavaScript class made by the TensorFlow.js team to do the hardwork for you. No machine learning knowledge is needed. See our other tutorials if you want to load a model directly yourself, or recognize a custom object using your own data.

    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p><a href="https://glitch.com/~tensorflow-js-image-classification">See the README.md or the project page for more information</a> on what is going on</p>
    
    <p>If what you want to recognize is in that list of things it knows about, this may be useful to you as is, or just to experiment with Machine Learning in the browser and get familiar with ML.</p>
